# Project Car classifier

1. Started to find a dataset, first I tried to find a dataset by myself. Tried to find all the pics by myself. As a Used car dealer I thought I had enough pictures just by my own library
but that wasn't enough. After some searching and downloading pictures itself I found this dataset on the ethernet : ![Stanford dataset](fotos/Stanford.png)

2. It were all random pictures so I kept searching on a dataset where someone already mapped the photo's. I found one on Kaggle.com : ![Kaggle](fotos/Kaggle.png)

3. I tried to make a car classifier in Jupyter notebook with Keras. Tried multiple times with other Epochs and different Batch sizes but the conclusion was that Keras wasn't good in my situation because you can only get it to work with your GPU if you are a  Nvidia Developer. Training the model took between the 24 hours and the 36 hours : ![Epochs](fotos/Epoch.png)
